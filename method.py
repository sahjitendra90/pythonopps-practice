# 2. Methods

# Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object.

# Example 2 : Creating Methods in Python

class Parrot:

    # instance attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # instance method
    def sing(self, song):
        return "{} sings {}".format(self.name, song)

    def dance(self):
        return "{} is now dancing".format(self.name)


# instantiate the object
blu = Parrot("Blu", 10)

# call our instance methods
print(blu.sing("Happy"))
print(blu.dance())

# In the above program, we define two methods i.e sing() and dance().
# These are called instance methods because they are called on an instance object i.e blu.
